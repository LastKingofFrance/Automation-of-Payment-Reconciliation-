Well this is my first time writing this. 
The code above helped reduce the reconciliation of stock and costs payment structure for a major hospital. 
Previously this type of task was done using Excel. 
It involved a lot of manual work primarily using tools such as pivot tables, vlookup and manually searching for document numbers. 
The issue with the above is that at various points individuals needed to both insert and delete formulas in Excel. 
I.e. copy pasting but only pasting the values. 
This can result in errors and when they do a future person may not know how to handle data with no discernible formulas in excel. 
The code I made, may be improved in future, but enables an individual to just insert the necessary lab excel and it will export the important information needed for the reconciliation file.
